\title{Learning Function for 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)}
\usage{
learn_dwt(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix with `n` rows (observations) and `p` columns (variables).
The number of columns must be padded to a dyadic length internally.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item `Encode`: A function to encode data into a thresholded wavelet space.
                    Takes arguments `Y` (data matrix) and `k` (number of coefficients to retain).
    \item `Decode`: A function to reconstruct data from the thresholded wavelet coefficients.
  }
}
\description{
This function applies the 1-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to encode and decode
data using energy-based thresholding of wavelet coefficients.
}
\details{
The function uses wavelet coefficients' relative energy to rank their importance. The
thresholding mechanism retains the `k` most important coefficients for encoding.
